# Day 12: Complete Code Generation

In this lab, you complete your code generator to handle arbitrary MiniJava programs.

## Overview

### Objectives

1. Write MiniJava programs and corresponding Jasmin programs which cover the following constructs:
    
    * classes with fields,
    * methods with parameters and local variables,
    * variable and field access,
    * both kinds of assignments,
    * method calls with arguments.
    
2. Extend your code generator to handle these constructs.

### Submission

You need to submit your MiniJava project on Blackboard. 
As part of your submission, we ask you to provide a short paragraph explaining the organisation of your MiniJava examples, the corresponding Jasmin files, and your Stratego files. 
When you solved challenges, you should provide another paragraph sketching your approach.
The deadline for submission is January 8, 17:59.

### Grading

You can earn up to 25 points for your example MiniJava programs and their corresponding Jasmin programs.
We will focus on completeness and correctness of your examples.
Furthermore, you can earn up to 65 points for your code generator:

* transformation (55 points)
    * types (5 points)
    * fields (10 points)
    * methods (15 points)
    * variables (10 points)
    * assignments (15 points)
* challenges (10 points)
    * reusable field descriptors (2 points)
    * reusable variable accessors (2 points)
    * debug information (6 points)

You can earn up to 5 points for the organisation of your Stratego files and up to 5 points for the quality of your code. 
We focus on readibility in general, meaningful variable names and the consistent use of Stratego paragdims. 
We will consider the fact that Stratego is new to you.

In this assignment, we also give you the chance to earn up to 10 bonus points.
This works like a challenge, but it gives you extra points on top of the total points of your assignment.

## Detailed Instructions

### Write Even More Jasmin Code

Before you complete your code generator, you should come up with small example MiniJava programs, which cover the following constructs:

* fields, 
* parameters and local variables,
* variable and field access, 
* assignments, and
* method calls with arguments.

Write corresponding Jasmin programs, which you expect to be the result of a MiniJava-to-Jasmin compiler. 
Generate Java class files from them and run them. 
Improve your programs until they run without errors.

### Generate Code for Fields and Field Access

You now need to extend your code generator to handle field declarations and field access. 

1. Provide rules for `type-to-jbc`, which translate MiniJava types into Jasmin types as used in field and method descriptors. 

2. Provide a rule for `field-to-jbc`, which translates field declarations from MiniJava into Jasmin field declarations.

3. Extend your rules for `class-to-jbc` to handle field declarations.

4. Provide a rule for `exp-to-jbc`, which translates field access expressions from MiniJava into sequences of Java bytecode instructions.
 
5. Provide a rule for `stmt-to-jbc`, which translates assignments to fields from MiniJava into sequences of Java bytecode instructions. 
   This rule should call `exp-to-jbc` to translate expressions to Java bytecode sequences.

6. Provide a rule for `stmt-to-jbc`, which translates array assignments to fields from MiniJava into sequences of Java bytecode instructions.

You can test each rule by selecting a code fragment in the MiniJava editor and running your code generation builder.

### Generate Code for Local Variables and Variable Access

Finally, you need to extend your code generator to cover parameters, local variables,  and access to them.

1. Declare a custom property `var-index` of type `Int` for the namespace `Variable` in an NaBL file.
   See the challenges from last week on how to declare such a property.

2. Store the index `i` of each parameter and local variable on its name by applying `store-var-index(|ctx, i)` to its name.
   See the challenges from last week on how to store properties on names.
   In order to calculate indices, you need to match the method declaration, not the parameter or variable declarations.
   The following strategies might be useful:
    * `map-with-index(s)` works like `map(s)`, but applies `s` to pairs `(i, e)` where `e` is an element of the list and `i` is the index of this element in the list.   
    * `nmap(s|i)` maps `s` over a list where the strategy `s` takes the index `i` as a term argument and increments `i` after each element.   

   Parameters are indexed from left to right, starting with `1`.
   Local variables can be indexed in arbitrary order, starting with the next available index.
   
3. Extend your rule for `method-to-jbc`, which handles method declarations.
   Support parameters by generating variable declarations, which map variable numbers in generated Java bytecode to variable names in the original MiniJava program. 
   Do the same for local variables. 
   To get the variable number associated with a parameter or local variable, apply `get-var-index` to its name.
  
3. Extend your rule for `exp-to-jbc`, which handles method calls.
   Support calls with arguments by calling `exp-to-jbc` recursively to translate argument expressions.

4. Provide a rule for `exp-to-jbc`, which translates variable access expressions from MiniJava into sequences of Java bytecode instructions.

5. Provide a rule for `stmt-to-jbc`, which translates assignments to variables from MiniJava into sequences of Java bytecode instructions.
   This rule should call `exp-to-jbc` to translate expressions to Java bytecode sequences.

6. Provide a rule for `stmt-to-jbc`, which translates array assignments to variables from MiniJava into sequences of Java bytecode instructions.
   This rule should call `exp-to-jbc` to translate expressions to Java bytecode sequences.

### Note about Jasmin

Even though in MiniJava some keywords are reserved, Jasmin may add a couple of its own. This are names which are a valid statement in Jasmin itself, such as `field` or `class`. Our parser does not reject these, but those cause parse errors when compiling the Jasmin file to Java in quite some Jasmin implementations since these may not have the latest updates (Debian for example). See [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10371352/how-to-handle-field-named-as-keywords-in-jasmin) for more information about this.

### Challenges

Challenges are meant to distinguish excellent solutions from good solutions. 
Typically, they are less guided and require more investigation and programming skills.

#### Reusable Field Descriptors

Store and retrieve field descriptors or field references instead of re-generating them in different places.
See the challenges from last week to get an idea how this can be achieved.

#### Reusable Variable Accessors

In your current implementation, you generate load and store instructions for parameters and local variables over and over again.
Avoid this by storing and retreiving these instructions instead of storing their index.

#### Generate Debug Information

Real-life compilers add debug information to generated code. 
This information is used by debuggers, but also in runtime error messages. 

Write a MiniJava program that causes a runtime exception, e.g. by accessing an array out of bound. 
When you compile this program to Java classes and run it in the virtual machine, you expect the runtime error to report you the position of the expression causing the error in the source code. 
To achieve this behaviour, you need to add source file and line number directives.

1. Extend your `class-to-jbc` rules for classes, to include a source file directive pointing to the MiniJava file you compile. 

2. When compiling expressions and statements, you can add line number directives in front of the resulting Java Bytecode instructions. 
   To find out the line number of an AST element, you can apply the strategy `origin-line` from the `editor/origins` library. 
   Instead of adding code for line numbers to every rule of `exp-to-jbc` and `stmt-to-jbc`, you should define new strategies `exp-to-jbc-ln` and `stmt-to-jbc-ln` which generates just  the line number directive and calls your original code generation strategies `exp-to-jbc` or `stmt-to-jbc`, respectively. 
Next, replace applications of `exp-to-jbc` and `stmt-to-jbc` by `exp-to-jbc-ln` and `stmt-to-jbc-ln` wherever you need to generate line numbers.

3. It is pretty common, that several expression occur in the same line. 
   In this case, you should generate only a single line number directive. 
   To achieve this, you have various options:

    1. Remove redundant line number directives in a post-processing step.
    2. Keep track of already used line numbers by passing a state as a term argument to strategy invocations.
    3. Maintain a state using [dynamic rules](http://eelcovisser.org/post/268/dynamic-rewrite-rules---the-good-parts).
    4. Maintain a state in the index. 


### Bonus

#### Generate Precise Ranges for Local Variables

A precise range of a local variable covers only the parts in the code where the variable is defined and used:

* There is only one continuous range for each variable (in contrast, variable liveness as discussed in the lecture can be fragmented). 
* The range should cover at least all instructions between the first and last load or store (whatever comes first/last) of a local variable. 
* Loops might extend the range, since they might require a variable to survive.

You should extend your code generator to generate precise ranges.
Similar to the stack limit challenge from last week, the analysis should be performed on the MiniJava code, not on the Java bytecode.
